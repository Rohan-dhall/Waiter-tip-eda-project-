## Correlation Analysis

### Key Findings:
1. **Total Bill and Tip**: Strong positive correlation (0.68). Larger bills are associated with higher tips.
2. **Total Bill and Group Size**: Moderate positive correlation (0.60). Bigger groups tend to generate larger bills.
3. **Tip and Group Size**: Moderate positive correlation (0.49). Larger groups tend to leave larger tips.

## Analysis Goals

The analysis aims to:
1. Explore distributions and relationships across variables.
2. Identify patterns in tipping behavior based on customer demographics (e.g., gender, smoker status).
3. Understand temporal patterns (e.g., differences between lunch and dinner, weekday vs. weekend).
4. Provide actionable insights for restaurant management to optimize service and revenue.

## Usage

### For Analysts:
The dataset is ideal for studying:
- Correlations between bill amounts, tips, and group sizes.
- Customer behavior differences based on demographics (e.g., gender, smoking status).
- Temporal tipping trends across different days and times.

### For Developers:
The dataset can be used for:
- Machine learning models to predict tip amounts.
- Simulations of customer behavior based on demographic and temporal factors.
- Building dashboards for restaurant data visualization.

## Future Work

1. Perform hypothesis testing to validate differences across groups (e.g., smoker vs. non-smoker tips).
2. Explore tipping patterns by day of the week to identify high-revenue periods.
3. Build predictive models for tipping amounts based on bill size, group size, and other factors.
